# 📰 Pocket News

A mobile news app for discovering, searching, and reading news articles from around the world whilst providing a means to translate them to different languages, powered by the **NewsAPI.org** and **MistralAI API**.  
_This project is developed as part of an app development course._

# NOTE :

You need a .env file in root of the project and in it you need both a NewsAPI Key saved in it and a MistralAI API Key, both are free to grab.

- **NewsAPI Key** : https://newsapi.org/
- **MistralAPI** : https://mistral.ai/

Because of the limitation of free API keys , rate limit errors can occur, especially with Mistral.
These Rate limit slightly missleading when it comes to Mistral , my own testing showed that neither request or token limits are hit when sometimes a 429 error limit is hit.
Instead what is happening , the free tier key will sometimes get thorttled by the API system to give more head room for premium paid key requests , so if you get an error
just keep re-trying, it's a ficle API, sometimes you can translate 10 things without issues, other times even using it for the first time in a day it hits you with a rate error and you gotta retry a few times or a wait a bit.

### Apart from that , the rest is the usual :

- NPM install to get all depedencies needed for the project auto installed
- Have Expog go set up on your VSC and Phone to scan the QR so you can run on your phone for testing (or set up a virutal machine phone)

## ✅ Must Haves

- **Search & Filter:**  
  Search for news articles using keywords. Filter results by country and sort by latest or other available options provided by the API.

  Display article titles and summaries/snippets.
- **Open Full Article:**  
  Clicking/tapping an article opens the full article in the user’s browser.
- **Decent UI:**  
  The app will have a clean and easy-to-navigate user interface.
- **Centralized API system:**
  Make sure APi is centralized and not hardcoded to screens

## ✨ Should Haves

- **2D World Map:**  
  🗺️ Interactive or just asthetic 2D map where users see the whole world displayed.
- **AI Or Other Means Of Translation:**  
  🤖 Integrate Mistral AI to translate article titles and snippets. Users can select a language, and the AI will translate the selected article’s info that the news API gives it.
  If problems occur with the AI API, look into alternative means to do/request translations of non-english articles
- **Caching:**
  Cache data, so if a user goes back to a previous screen or sees the same article, it doesn't need to request that again from the API

## 💡 Nice to Have

- **3D Globe:**  
  🌐 Replace the 2D map with a 3D interactive globe for a more engaging experience.
